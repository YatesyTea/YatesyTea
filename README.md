Hi, I'm Dan,

I've been very much enjoying my wide array of responsibilities in my current role, I believe it's given me a good purview of the overall software development cycle and am always looking for ways to improve each and every aspect of it!

I make personal tools to deal with nitpicks / issues I've run into during my days at work or even for my friends or partner.

I really enjoy drinking a variety of teas whilst I code almost as much as I enjoy clear and easy to navigate docs so a nearby kettle is an absolute must 🍵


## Main Technologies
* Playwright 🎭 e2e testing suite (Honestly this suite has the best docs I ❤️ them)
* C# .Net
* Typescript / Vue
* Vitest suite
* Astro 🚀
* Linear for Project Management
* Github CI/CD for testing pipelines and deployment

## Other Experience
* Experience in Agile environment, with scrum management.
  * Including Project Kanban, Burndown, Project and Sprint Backlogs.
* Creation of User Stories, Use Case Diagrams, and Feature Lists.
  * Used Astah and Star UML tooling.
* LaTeX for final year project and CV creation.
* Vim and NeoVim for editing remotely.
* Usage of Linear, Jira, Github Projects, Google Sheets, and Microsoft Project for project planning.
* Have daily driven all major operating systems:
  * Windows - Winget, WSL with Docker, VSC integrations with Docker.
  * Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 and Fedora 36) - Apt, Rpm, Bash, Boxes, Docker, Flatpak.
  * MacOS - Brew, Xcode.
 
 ## Hobbies
 * Self taught piano, attending open mic nights.
 * Learning foods from around the world (do feel free to message me some good recipes!)
 * Soldering mechanical keyboards.
 * And my favourite, gong fu brewing of tea!
 
 Thanks for Reading this, and hope you enjoy the pinned projects below.
